## Interview ng App Exercise

- Using the DogListContainer component, use a nested component to display a list of dogs.
	- Use the models found in models.ts
	- The UI doesnâ€™t need to be polished
- Display a list of all the dogs found in the dogs model
- Display a second list of only those dogs that are available (have not yet found a human)
- Display a list, table or grid of all dogs along with all handlers who meet each dog's requirements for yearsExperience
  - if a dog is newly arrived, the minimum years experience needed is 2
- Don't use .subscribe()
- Don't make unnecessary, duplicate api calls

- Extra: Provide a mechanism to filter the first list by Status or Breed
